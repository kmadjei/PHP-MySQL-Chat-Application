## Testing


### Bugs During development

- Validation error messages not showing up on the client side browser
    - Code for injecting error messages was un-commented
    - changed
- users page only show current user logged in without listing the status of other users
    -   changed the **php/users.php** script to contain the following code
    
    ```php
        <?php 
            session_start();
            include_once "config.php";
            $outgoing_id = $_SESSION['unique_id'];
            $sql = mysqli_query($conn, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE NOT unique_id = {$outgoing_id} ORDER BY user_id DESC");
            $output = "";

            if (mysqli_num_rows($sql) == 0) {
                $output .= "No users are available to chat with!";
            } elseif (mysqli_num_rows($sql) > 0) {
                include "data.php";
            }
            echo $output;
        ?>
    ```

- logging in does not redirect user to chat page
    - changed `echo "Success";` to `echo "success";` in **php/login.php**

- chat message not being sent and received from database
    - resolution steps:
        - Corrected `$SESSION[]` to `$_SESSION[]` for **insert-chat.php and get-chat.php** files
        - included the `name=message` attribute for the input-field element in the **chat.php** file
        - Corrected 
        
        ```php 
            $message = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['outgoing_id']); 
            To 
            $message = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['message']); 
        ```

        for **php/insert.php** file

- Warning: Undefined array key "outgoig_msg_id" in C:\xampp\htdocs\PHP-Projects\chat app\php\data.php on line 18
    - Resolution:

    Changed
    ```php
        ($outgoing_id == $row2['outgoing_msg_id']) ? $you = "You: " : $you = "";
    ```

    To this 
    ```php 
    if(isset($row2['outgoing_msg_id'])){
            ($outgoing_id == $row2['outgoing_msg_id']) ? $you = "You: " : $you = "";
        }else{
            $you = ""; 
    ```

### Acknowledgements

- Through this one project alone I was able to learn MySQL queries, PHP authentication, JavaScript-PHP Ajax, and File submission, along with new knowledge on Javascript functions and CSS selectors.
    - I am grateful for the valuable lesson and will recommend any PHP full-stack developer to give it a go.
